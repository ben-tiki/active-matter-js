# Active Matter Simulation
This projects creates Boids or "Bird-like" objects moving on the canvas, simulatating the flocking behaviour of birds.

### Rules: 

 1. Birds start at a random position on the canvas.
 2. Each bird has a random initial x_vector and y_vector (defining the direction it will move)
 3. If a bird is within the interaction radius of another it is considered a "neighbor"
 4. If neighbor, the bird will allign its movement with other birds
 5. Each bird has a random "noise" in their movement
